            <p>This isn't my first time doing the Codecademy Full Stack Engineering (FSE) Career Path. Around four to six months ago, I made 15% progress on the FSE career path before my hiatus. Even though I could revise the information via active recall, I decided to reset my progress and start from scratch once again. My main reason for doing this was so that I could get some feedback while reviewing the course materials. Codecademy‒and no, I'm not sponsored by them or anything‒has interactive courses and a workspace that allows you to practice the lessons and see the rendering in a panel to the right. This format is most effective for learning due to the feedback-loop mechanism that's in place, in addition to the ability to see the visualisations of your code. This format isn't unique to Codecademy. Other learning platforms, such as Synthesis, Brilliant, and Khan Academy, have interactive learning environments‒ this is the future of learning.</p>
