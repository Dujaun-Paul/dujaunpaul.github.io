            <p>This isn't my first time doing the Codecademy Full Stack Engineering (FSE) Career Path. Around four to six months ago, I made 15% progress on the FSE career path before my hiatus. Even though I could revise the information via active recall, I decided to reset my progress and start from scratch once again. My main reason for doing this was so that I could get some feedback while reviewing the course materials. Codecademy‒and no, I'm not sponsored by them or anything‒has interactive courses and a workspace that allows you to practice the lessons and see the rendering in a panel to the right. This format is most effective for learning due to the feedback-loop mechanism that's in place, in addition to the ability to see the visualisations of your code. This format isn't unique to Codecademy. Other learning platforms, such as Synthesis, Brilliant, and Khan Academy, have interactive learning environments‒ this is the future of learning.</p>

        <h2>Learnings</h2>
         <p>HyperText Markup Language is a computer language that annotates raw text or data on a webpage. It defines the structure and content of websites and serves as the foundation for all webpages on the World Wide Web (Web). Web browsers interpret the HTML and render it through various built-in layout mechanisms. What makes HTML hyper is its ability to link to other HTML documents, via hyperlinks, like this, expanding beyond the traditional constraints of the written word. This is what allows us to browse or surf the Web and is more efficient than typing whole URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) into search bars each time we want to locate a webpage or resource on the Web.<br>The language was invented in 1993, just four years after the invention of the Web, by the same inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, during his tenure at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), to facilitate the sharing of information and documents among scientists, allowing them to create a system of interconnected documents using hypertext links. <br>Thanks to these inventions, we're able to share and watch cat videos online and harass our friends and families with brain-rot Instagram and TikTok reels. We're currently on version five, and its standards are actively developed and maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), which was also founded by Tim Berners-Lee.</p>

        <h2>HTML Anatomy</h2>
        <img src="Images\HTML Anatomy.png" alt="The anatomy of HTML" width="500" height="300">
            <p>HTML elements, or simply elements, are the building blocks of an HTML document. They consist of opening and closing HTML tags that enclose content, and this content, whether text, images, or other elements, is an integral part of the element itself. These tags provide the structure and markup for the content, instructing web browsers on how to render the data, which ultimately defines the content and layout of a webpage.</p>

        <h2>HTML Structure</h2>
        <img src="Images\HTML Structure.jpg" alt="The structure of HTML" width="500" height="300">
            <p>Furthermore, HTML is structured and organised as a collection of family tree relationships. This concept is known as the HTML hierarchy: the relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendant elements. Elements that are nested within other elements are called child elements or descendants, while elements that nest or contain other elements are referred to as parent elements or ancestors. Elements that are at the same level of indentation within the same parent are called siblings. The family tree metaphor is a helpful way to visualise this structure, and it's essential to remember, especially when applying CSS, as these relationships impact styling and layout.</p>

        <h2>Appreciation</h2>
            <p>I've developed a newfound appreciation for these technologies. While they have been misused by bad actors for harmful purposes, I, along with many others, have gained tremendous benefit from them. One of the most significant advantages is how they have facilitated the global dissemination of high-quality, free, and interconnected information, much of which I've used to improve myself.</p>

        <h2>Does God exist?</h2>
            <p>The question of whether HTML is a programming language is as contentious and widely debated as the existence of gods in the philosophy of religion. While I'd love to dive into that discussion (though I’d rather not), fortunately, it's beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I know that the significance of this technology is lost on many individuals, a phenomenon that's not unique to this domain. We're all immersed in our own life projects, often caught up in the hustle of everyday challenges. However, for those of us who are venturing down this path, let's push ourselves further—let's explore new depths of knowledge and technological sophistication. As we delve deeper, we’ll uncover insights that may not be immediately apparent to the masses but will ultimately influence them in ways they can't help but appreciate, even if indirectly. HTML, in particular, has played a pivotal role in shaping the modern world, and its influence will only continue to grow. Let's not just use it, but let’s empower it to reach its fullest potential and beyond—helping to build a future that is as innovative as it is impactful. Together, we can make sure its legacy continues to evolve, one line of code at a time.</p>
