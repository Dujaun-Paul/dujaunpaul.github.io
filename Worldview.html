    <h2>Worldview</h2>
        <p>In this section, I’ll present my worldview — my philosophical positions, beliefs, and values — the mental architecture that makes me who I am. Like any real codebase, mine is constantly evolving. I’m always debugging, patching, pushing commits, and sometimes rewriting entire modules.
        This blog is where I work in the open: sharing ideas, exposing them to scrutiny, and inviting feedback — in good faith — to help refine my understanding of the world. I want to approach this process scientifically: testable, changeable, always improving.
        Writing also sharpens thought. Seeing ideas on the page helps me interrogate them, spot inconsistencies, and build clarity.</p>
