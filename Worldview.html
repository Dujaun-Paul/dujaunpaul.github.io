    <h2>Worldview</h2>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>For better or for worse it seems that I am a constructivist. I like to build stuff, including and especially regarding frameworks for navigating reality. Here, I present my uniquely designed worldview.</p>
    <h2>Core frameworks</h2>
        <h3>Ontology & Metaphysics</h3>
        <h4>Metaphysical Realism</h4>
            <p>I the world is as it is independent of how humans or other inquiring agents take it to be. The objects the world contains, together with their properties and the relations they enter into, fix the world's nature and these objects [together with the properties they ahve and the relations they enter into] discover they do. Unless this is so, metaphysical realists arguue, none of our beliefs about our world could be objectively true since true beliefs tell us how things are and beleifs are objectivee when true or false independently of what anyone might think.</p>
        <h4>Ontology: Naturalism</h4>
            <p>Ontology is the study of being. It is the study of what exists and what it means to exist. It is the study of the nature of reality. It is the study of the categories of being and their relations. It is the study of what it means to be.
